# react-hot-boilerplate

Dev environment to enable hot-live-editing for React components, preserving the state,
the state is handled with [redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) | [react-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux), and the routes with [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router). We used the [react-router-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router-redux) to connect the store with routes.

## Lazy Loading

We have a main component "Home" Inside of this will be loaded the children components, this is async and is performmed by SystemJS
